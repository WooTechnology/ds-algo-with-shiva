## Abstract
- This is approximately 8 week programs during which I intend to help my mentees to ace their interviews. Each topic is covered in details and questions are solved live by both mentor and mentees in class. We have covered all the levels of question in detail be it easy, medium or hard. Also I have resolved doubts of students live in class by looking through their code and finding bugs or errors in their code so thatthey can understand it in much better way. I have also provided questions daily as an assignment. The doubts of those assignments are taken every week.
